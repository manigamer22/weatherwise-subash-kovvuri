# ✍️ Project Reflection

AI Tools Used
Throughout the development of the WeatherWise project, I extensively used multiple AI tools, with ChatGPT being the main one for assistance. ChatGPT became an essential tool for both code design and debugging while aiding in OpenWeatherMap API integration and creation of natural language processing functions that processed user inquiries. The AI tool enabled me to write useful comments which enhanced the readability of my code. Additionally, GitHub Copilot’s autocompletion feature enabled me to quickly build functions, allowing me to concentrate more on logic and design.

Prompting Techniques
I improved the performance of these AI tools by using deliberate prompting strategies. I sought detailed instructions to handle intricate tasks such as retrieving data from APIs and creating visualizations. Every time I faced an issue or error, I looked for explanations along with best practice advice. I also asked for improvements to input validation techniques and exception handling to strengthen program stability. To better understand my learning progress and pinpoint improvement opportunities, I implemented reflection prompts as a key tool.

What Worked Well?
I take great pride in my ability to merge real-time API data retrieval, basic NLP for weather-related questions interpretation, and graphical data visualization into one seamless interactive application. The interface design is both simple and intuitive, so users can easily work with the system to get appropriate and natural responses.

What Would You Do Differently?
With additional time available, I would concentrate on enhancing the application by implementing real multi-day forecast data into the charts instead of using placeholder values. I plan to improve the NLP module by implementing better AI-based intent recognition technology to process a broader range of user questions. The development of a graphical user interface (GUI) would greatly enhance user experience over the existing text-based menu.

Final Thoughts
The project helped me gain better knowledge about how APIs work together with user interface design principles and AI tools for software development. ChatGPT helped speed up my learning process and taught me the importance of carefully assessing AI recommendations for correctness and applicability.
